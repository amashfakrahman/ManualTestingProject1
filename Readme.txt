Project Summary – nopCommerce Manual Testing

This project covers complete manual testing of the nopCommerce demo e-commerce website. I created and executed detailed test scenarios and test cases for all major modules, including Registration, Login, Home Page, Search, Product Display Page, and Checkout.

The testing focused on validating real user workflows such as creating an account, logging in, searching products, viewing product details, adding items to the cart, and completing the checkout process. I checked both positive and negative cases, field validations, UI behavior, error messages, performance, and usability.

Throughout the project, I documented all defects using a structured bug report format. Several critical issues were identified—such as missing email validation, failed search filters, non-functional checkout steps, and missing session handling.

Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to design test cases, execute them thoroughly, prioritize issues, and report bugs clearly while testing a full e-commerce application end-to-end.
